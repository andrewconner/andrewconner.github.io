<p>One of the most important things people with high information intake can do is be incredibly particular about <em>what</em> they consume. This lesson took me years to learn, and required fighting against strong media incentives.</p>
<p>This is my media diet, a digital bookshelf of sorts. <a href=https://andrewconner.com/posts/media-diet-podcasts-audiobooks/>Learn more about why I do this, and how I built my reading habit</a>. Sporadically, I write short summaries of books and media that I&rsquo;ve consumed.</p>
<p>This is dominated by non-fiction books, though if something else was particularly notable, I&rsquo;ll include it.</p>

<div class=post-content><p>Once I got the gist of Godlin&rsquo;s point, I struggled to get through this. Though, <em>it&rsquo;s good</em>. If, like me, you already see the value in avoiding &ldquo;cog-based&rdquo; work, there&rsquo;s not a whole lot that is novel. If you&rsquo;ve optimized your skills towards being very good, but likely replaceable, you may learn a lot. In fact, this book was recommended to me by someone who changed their work-life based on some principles here.</p>
<p>Critically, Seth under-estimates the coordination problem of having large companies full of linchpins. And, several of his examples of linchpin-driven companies—all of which are massively successful—I happen to know are full of monotony, bureaucracy, and cog-work. So, at it&rsquo;s worst, it&rsquo;s a repetitive, motivational-blog-style treatise. At it&rsquo;s best, it codifies important principles on succeeding in creative work.</p>

<div class=post-content><p>Jonathan Heidt’s The Righteous Mind has been one of my favorite reads for the past couple years, and so I was excited to read this one, specifically analyzing the shift towards several philosophies and thought patterns that produce fragile people. This shift starting in academia, but now extending to wider American culture. It’s characterized by a belief in these false ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>What doesn&rsquo;t kill you makes you weaker</li>
<li>Always trust your feelings</li>
<li>Life is a battle between good people and evil people</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Coddling</em> looks closely at how we got here, and why these 3 beliefs go against how we know our psychology works. Overall, it is fairly measured, even though it’s explicitly critical of how several social justice causes are advocated for currently.</p>

<div class=post-content><p>“The wedge” are activities and practices that separate us from natural environmental responses. The book details several “wedges”, such as cold plunges, fasting, sauna use, psychedelics, sensory depravation pools, certain exercises, etc that allow practitioners to expand their normal consciousness.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the chapter list looks nearly like my Woo post, so I was primed to like the book. Unfortunately, my guess is that most people with exposure to biohacking or similar practices would be well-aware of most practices that he details. The narrative seems to be written for people with minimal exposure to any of these, at times slowly trudging through inconsequential details. In fact, a few of the topics are ones that I happen to know quite a lot about, and the writing seems optimized for flow rather than rigor. Many of my examples of this are nits, but do impact the thesis being offered (example: for many people, raw potatoes observably do indeed significantly impart a high glucose load, so the idea that a short-term potato-only diet serves as a metabolic reset is strange). If you’re interested in these topics, such as Wim Hof-style cold exposure, and have minimal exposure, it may serve as a highly-accessible primer. Otherwise, I’d say skip — there’s not really anything new here.</p>

<div class=post-content><p>Ezra Klein, founder of Vox, details how media incentives, demographic shifts, and the internet / niche news have resulted in natural polarization in America. Full disclosure: I went into this book skeptical, but tried to give it as fair of a chance as I could. Overall, his thesis is <em>fine</em>, and he even comes close to recognizing his own active role in the problem, but stops just shy. He’s astute at pointing out how right wing media, catering to the white, middle class in America, has polarized center-right.</p>
<p>But, he misses the chance to dive deeply into how he is also culpable via Vox, which generates traffic on outrage, oversimplification of complex issues, and one-sided reporting. In fact, by so lucidly pointing at the failings of the right, the reader could be forgiven for thinking that Klein actually <em>gets it</em> and is working against these incentives. Based on reading much of Klein&rsquo;s work and listening to debates he&rsquo;s done, I have low confidence he does. So, overall, the book falls flat.

<div class=post-content><p>Before Andrew Yang was famous for losing political elections, he founded Venture for America. This book is the story and thesis of VFA, arguing against the current pipeline of sending our best and brightest to law school and management consultant companies. Instead of creating more professional service workers, he argues, we should equip and train people to <em>build new things</em>. In Silicon Valley, this is an obvious train of thought, but isn&rsquo;t common outside. And naturally, VFA focuses primarily outside of major metropolitan areas where tech is already known to be a good career.</p>
<p>It’s a great, quick read, and changed how I viewed the current educational/professional pipeline. I highly recommend it to policy makers and high schoolers thinking about career options. It&rsquo;s pointing to a real risk for America&rsquo;s future and society, and provides a techno-optimist framing towards the solution. The book has one primary idea, so once you get the gist of it, feel free to skim or skip the rest unless you also love the story.</p>

<div class=post-content><p>In my friend circle, this book has been both recommended as one of the most impactful reads published in the past few years, and also one of the most overrated. I think I get it.</p>
<p>The dialogue in the English translation—and perhaps the original?—is quite contrived and, at times, condescending. It&rsquo;s a Socratic-style conversation between a young person and a sage-like philosopher, talking about <a href=https://www.alfredadler.org/what-is-an-adlerian>Adlerian psychology</a>. I learned a lot, and it&rsquo;s helped me reframe my actions into goals-based evaluations (What goal do I have that leads to this behavior?).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s several overlapping ideas between Adlerian psychology and <a href=https://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/aboutnvc/aboutnvc.htm>Nonviolent Communication</a>. I recommend the print book over the audiobook due to the narration style.</p>

<div class=post-content><p>This is an interesting book, in that it serves as sort of a bundle to many arguments against toxic masculinity. Or, more accurately, it provides a model that celebrates the author’s brand of masculinity, and has strong critiques of how many men live currently. It embraces a deeply spiritual, mission-driven, strong idea of man-hood.</p>
<p>If you’re politically oriented like me, you’ll probably strongly disagree with portions of this book. I’d rather not write a specific critique of it, however, because it’d be too long, but in summary, there’s a lot that feels outdated / offensive, and a lot that provided a fresh perspective of masculinity for me. However, I did like how he supports a polarity spectrum of gender that provides balance for people. Overall, I&rsquo;m glad I read it, but probably wouldn’t reference again.</p>

<div class=post-content><p>Friends of mine know that I love talking and complaining about American urban development philosophy. <a href=https://www.strongtowns.org/>Strong Towns</a> is a non-profit that has written about the fragility and risks of the dominate structural growth philosophy underlying many American cities and towns. Unfortunately, the blog isn&rsquo;t super well structured—in my opinion—and has <em>many</em> ideas that are difficult to distill into a cohesive argument. The exact meanings and implications of their philosophies are fairly complex, though. Overall, they’re advocating for cities and towns to be run profitably, where growth does not obfuscate long term liabilities, and where wealth is generated and retained.</p>
<p>For years, I’ve felt that the American experiment of city and suburban development felt broken, but I wasn’t sure why. Strong Towns (the book) is in the single best summary of how cities used to be built, how they’re built now, and what breaks. It tells the story of American development, focusing on the suburban expansionary post-WW2 period, and how we&rsquo;ve failed ourselves. At times, it&rsquo;s bleak: what if Detroit and Ferguson are not unique, but just early? It’s full of really interesting insights, such as how towns can best invest capital, where wealth is made/lost (it’s not where you’d think), and what’s in store for the future of many American cities. I’d recommend this book above other urban planning books to people new to this due to how accessible and easy to read it is.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re into city planning, development, and thoughtful growth, I highly recommend this book.</p>

<div class=post-content><p>Max Tegmark has an unusual idea: reality is just a mathematical structure. This is a bold claim about reality, so to get those of us there, he walks through a journey of what we know about our universe and how we know it. More importantly, he builds to focus on what the same mathematical underpinnings we use <em>in</em> our universe predict about things we can&rsquo;t directly observe.</p>
<p>To get anywhere close to explaining his ultimate theory, he spends sufficient time explaining the cosmos, with successes and failures of previous theories, so even a non-academic can understand where multiverses came about.</p>
<p>Part &ldquo;introduction to the cosmos&rdquo;, part memoir, part philosophy, Tegmark&rsquo;s journey is brilliant and enjoyable. The most meaningful portion for me was a metaphor he offered for life. I&rsquo;ll write more about this later.</p>

<div class=post-content><p>Confession: I held off reading this one for several months <em>because</em> of the title. I assumed it was some sort of exposé on VC, or perhaps &ldquo;history of A18Z&rdquo;. I was entirely wrong: this book provides the background, incentives, and purpose of venture capital and starting a VC-funded company. It covers everything from governance, term sheets, equity splits, board member duties (and legal obligations), and a lot more.</p>
<p>The chapter on Term Sheets is worth the book alone. Despite living a short drive from Sand Hill for the past 7 years, I&rsquo;ve never seen something written that&rsquo;s so clear. All founders interested in VC should be aware how deals are negotiated, what the terms mean, and how it&rsquo;ll affect them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also provides a great insight into VC incentives. How are <em>they</em> paid? What do their LPs want? This, and a lot more. I can&rsquo;t recommend this book enough to anyone interested in raising venture capital.</p>

<p>As a kid, I loved card magic. I collected special decks, pamphlets from experienced magicians, and books detailing advanced techniques. Almost 15 years ago, I watched Richard Turner&rsquo;s instructional DVDs <a href=https://www.penguinmagic.com/p/7424>Fans, Flourishes, and False Shuffles</a> and <a href=https://www.penguinmagic.com/p/7426>The Cheat</a>, and was blown away by his skills.</p>
<p>This documentary is a human story, far more than a magic or card story. He&rsquo;s one of the greatest due to sheer dedication and obsession: he practices card mechanic skills nearly every waking hour. If you like learning about the lives of fascinating people, even if card magic is not your thing, you&rsquo;ll probably like this one.</p>

</aside>
<div class=post-content><p>Frankly, it&rsquo;s hard to find balance on many issues that directly support or reject specific world-views. Evolution is a prime example. <a href=https://www.people-press.org/2009/07/09/section-5-evolution-climate-change-and-other-issues/>Nearly all scientists</a> feel there is sufficient evidence for natural selection and evolution—including in humans—as the explanation of species breadth we see today. However, only 9% of white evangelicals agree. Even more surprising, each side is highly confident in their conclusion. They have arguments supporting their view, but it seems that neither side fully understands the other.</p>
<p>The result is a lot of talk past each other. Evolution is complicated and the evidence is nuanced. It&rsquo;s easy to construct a straw man argument that misinterprets the opposing position and then proceed to tear it down. Instead, if we genuinely are interested in truth, we must <a href=https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FhH8m5n8qGSSHsAgG/better-disagreement>steel man arguments</a>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in understanding evolution, either because you don&rsquo;t have a firm grasp of what arguments are being made—and more importantly, why people believe them—or because you think scientists are misguided, <em>Why Evolution is True</em> is the best book I&rsquo;ve come across to clearly outline the central claims and supporting evidence. Coyne covers precisely what scientists mean by &ldquo;evolution&rdquo; and &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo;, falsifiable and verifiable claims that have been made, what we would find that might discredit the theory, and what we have found after hypotheses were made. Throughout the book, he reviews battery of evidence we&rsquo;ve found, spanning geology, genetics, the fossil record, biology, and more. I learned a ton.</p>

</aside>
<div class=post-content><p>If you believe that markets are the most efficient way to allocate resources, what if their breadth was extended to be <em>far</em> beyond how they&rsquo;re used today? Posner and Weyl play with this concept, and deliver proposals outside the current political axis, leaving people of nearly every political persuasion both interested and aghast.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll focus on the proposal they get the most attention for, regarding property ownership. They offer an economic system that would implement a wealth tax, levied on all personal property valued at whatever you publicly declare its value to be. Except, anyone can immediately take ownership of anything of yours by exceeding your named price. This incentivizes accurate valuations, and encourages the optimal use of resources. If you undervalue property because you&rsquo;re underutilizing it, someone else can quite easily arbitrage this spread.</p>
<p>This is one of four <em>radical</em> ideas they present using markets. The others involve voting, immigration, corporate control, and data ownership.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the generous interpretation: their book is an interesting philosophy of economics, rather than literal ideas that could be adopted wholesale. That interpretation fueled many interesting hypothetical discussions I&rsquo;ve had recently. However, for me—a fairly layperson—there&rsquo;s significant flaws with many of them, but they&rsquo;re interesting to think about and guide how we build our future.</p>

<div class=post-content><p>I&rsquo;m a Ryan Holiday fan, have received a ton of value from other books of his, such as <a href=https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/trust-me-im-lying/>Trust Me I&rsquo;m Lying</a>. So, I had this one pre-ordered since it was announced. Stoicism, virtue ethics, and meditation? I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each of us has access to more information than we could reasonably use. We tell ourselves that it&rsquo;s part of our job, that we have to be &ldquo;on top of things,&rdquo; and so we give up precious time to news reports, meetings, and other forms of feedback&mldr; We must stop this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish to improve,&rdquo; Epictetus once said, &ldquo;be content to appear clueless or stupid in extraneous matters.&rdquo;
<cite>Ryan Holiday, <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Stillness-Key-Ryan-Holiday/dp/0525538585>Stillness is the Key</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, it did none of these well. It starts well, with several brilliant quotes, and it often dips into great insights. Some of my favorite chapters include thoughtful historical stories of leaders who valued stillness in hard situations. As a whole, though, it never came together into a cohesive unit.</p>
<p>Past half way, it seems to fall apart. The chapters are full of appeals to the bandwagon — if lots of smart people did <em>X</em>, then <em>X</em> is worth doing. His understanding of history is incomplete, which only tripped my detector when I realized that many historical counterexamples to his point were oddly left out. Furthermore, the structure of the book left overlapping ideas in disjoint sections to fit the &ldquo;mind&rdquo;, &ldquo;spirit&rdquo;, &ldquo;body&rdquo; form he chose.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re new to Stoicism, you&rsquo;ll pick up a lot. However, I&rsquo;d recommend starting with the <a href=https://smile.amazon.com/Meditations-New-Translation-Marcus-Aurelius/dp/0812968255>Gregory Hays translation of Meditations</a>.</p>

</aside>
<div class=post-content><p>Yuval Noah Harari narrates the history of human kind, starting from pre-history with many types of <em>sapiens</em> roaming the world, to modern days. Large popular works often make for wide targets of criticism—which you&rsquo;d see about <em>Sapiens</em> if you looked around. There&rsquo;s a lot to be critical of, but for me—uneducated in much of the anthropology and sociology underpinnings—there&rsquo;s also a lot to take away. Frankly, many of the vocal criticisms miss the point. Harari&rsquo;s greatest flaw is how he narrates as if detached from what he speaks about, as an unaffiliated observer reporting facts and observations; however, he frequently mixes well-agreed history with his opinions.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, his story telling led to many new revelations for me, even though many of the facts weren&rsquo;t all that surprising. For example, in the beginning he talks of human&rsquo;s ability to believe and live by <em>fictions</em>; we build our whole society based on them. Money, companies, countries, society, equality, rights, etc. are all constructs that we join together to believe. We&rsquo;re the only species that does this.</p>
<p>I learned a lot, and enjoyed the read. If you&rsquo;re willing to keep a skeptical mind and understand that much of this is Harari&rsquo;s own opinions, you&rsquo;ll likely enjoy it as well.</p>

<div class=post-content><p>Nonviolent Communication best thought of as a philosophy of language, and presents a communication technique that encourages compassion and giving from the heart. It centers around how language builds implicit power structures. It&rsquo;s an all-inclusive framework, but can be borrowed from as useful.

<p>I got a lot from this book, and it has improved my communication with others significantly.

</aside>
<div class=post-content><p>Spoiler: eat plants. I love this book, <em>and</em> am frustrated by it. Lots to love: Dr. Greger is motivated to help people be healthy and live longer; there&rsquo;s nothing else. The first part of the book looks at all the top modern killers (heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer, &mldr;), and gives evidence supporting plant-based diets. It&rsquo;s very well cited, and he&rsquo;s quite intelligent. Just like when reading Keto books, there&rsquo;s almost this underlying conspiratorial overlay on much of the evidence. Our science is largely funded by the food industry, who are in charge of informing policymakers of latest science. So, we end up with monoculture foods, sickly animals, and sugar-packed diets. The latter part of the book was more enjoyable for me, because it gave practical advice. I&rsquo;ve increased my berry, spice (especially turmeric), and flexseed consumption based on the evidence he cites.</p>
<p>Frustrated: the science is cherry picked to form the larger point: you should be vegan, or at least vegetarian. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s <em>wrong</em>, but feels incomplete. If he disagrees with other modern research, such as with saturated fat consumption or the role of dietary cholesterol in blood cholesterol, he should have confronted it directly. Instead, it&rsquo;s just assumed that dietary saturated fat and cholesterol are awful. Absolute vs relative risk is frequently ignored for many risk factors. The chapter on diabetes spends more time talking about saturated fat than sugar. So, lots to learn from, but feels a bit dogmatic.</p>

<div class=post-content><p>Our culture optimizes for &ldquo;the average&rdquo;. This isn&rsquo;t saying we encourage everyone to <em>be</em> average, but we measure <em>from</em> the average. This breaks down when a measure is &ldquo;jagged&rdquo;. Consider people of different sizes, and you&rsquo;re tasked to sort them from smallest to biggest. Do you do it by height? Well, this would rank a 1.5m tall obese person as &ldquo;smaller&rdquo; than a 1.6m very thin person. By weight? This has the same problem. As it turns out, &ldquo;size&rdquo; is jagged. This may seem silly, but we do the exact same thing with intelligence tests, clothing, standardized tests, and even norms. There is no &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; beauty measure or &ldquo;smartest&rdquo; intelligence measure, we measure nearly everything as if there were smooth metrics. No one is actually &ldquo;average&rdquo;.</p>

This one&rsquo;s short, and is <em>okay</em>. His arguments are not the most intellectually rigorous, but I&rsquo;m not sure that was his intention. Rather than an exploration of determinism, his goal is to show that if you look closely for &ldquo;the one who thinks,&rdquo; it disappears. Thoughts appear in consciousness, and the autonomy we believe we have is an illusion — in fact, the illusion isn&rsquo;t even there. If you haven&rsquo;t explored this, it&rsquo;s a hard concept to grasp. If this sounds like gobbledygook, you&rsquo;ll likely get little from this book.

<div class=post-content><p>This book is delightful. I struggle with creativity: it hasn&rsquo;t previously <em>felt</em> accessible, and never productive. Gilbert thinks that&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The universe buries strange jewels deep within us all, and then stands back to see if we can find them. The hunt to uncover those jewels — that’s creative living. The courage to go on that hunt in the first place — that’s what separates a mundane existence from a more enchanted one.”</p>

<div class=post-content><p>I&rsquo;m a bit torn on this one. The advice inside is likely quite useful for many people, advocating for a modern interpretation of &ldquo;networking&rdquo;. However, at least among people I work with, much of the advice is well-known and not surprising. <span class=read-this-if>Read this if:</span> you find the concept of networking pointless or overwhelming. There are incredible benefits to building a wide, diverse network.</p>

<div class=post-content><p>This doesn&rsquo;t have a unified philosophy on productivity. It&rsquo;s a book with a <em>ton</em> of tactics on focusing and working more effectively. However, it&rsquo;s far too long, and felt like a grab-bag of all the tips and tricks the authors could come up with around productivity. Don&rsquo;t go on Facebook, focus on one thing, avoid the news, exercise, don&rsquo;t drink too much coffee, hang out with friends, etc.</p>

</aside>
<div class=post-content><p>Jocko and Leif advocate for better leadership through &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; ownership: taking ownership of outcomes, no matter who is directly at fault. It&rsquo;s a pleasant read, mixing practical &ldquo;real world&rdquo; advice with war stories. The crux, however, could have been delivered in a blog post. You&rsquo;ll be a far more effective leader when you take full ownership of everything under your purview.</p>

</aside>
<div class=post-content><p>Gawande considers aging and the slow process of modern death. Told alongside the story of his own father&rsquo;s death, he asks deep questions about mortality, end of life care, and autonomy. In an age of copious medical options, he advocates for a more holistic perspective on aging. He advocates for simple things, such as focusing on quality of life—which paradoxically often extends life, more than aggressive disease management. The book takes courage, especially if you have loved ones going through end of life care.</p>

</aside>
<div class=post-content><p>Annie Duke, renowned poker player, writes about applying poker thinking to life. Specifically, separating outcomes from expected value, and making choices with incomplete information. If you&rsquo;ve played a lot of poker—or, traded in financial markets—there&rsquo;s not too much surprising here.</p>
<p>In terms of applicable value, the lesson is fairly short, and could have been a blog post. Seek contrarian opinions and evidence against your biases. Don&rsquo;t blame negative outcomes on bad luck or necessarily bad decision making: the outcome only has a loose connection to the quality of the decision. Review decisions with other smart, experienced people.</p>

</aside>
<div class=post-content><p>This book changed the way I thought about morals, beliefs, and communication. Presented as a philosophy of morals—such as surveying the different types of morals we see in cultures—this book craft-fully made me think about my own moral compass. What do I value? Where do I place my values?</p>
<p>We make decisions without critical thinking, and are masters at explaining our decisions with rationality. We have this (shared) illusion that our beliefs are based in rationality, and thus when we disagree, we hit roadblocks. <em>How can they possibly believe that?</em> There is a solution, however; it may be why conservative talking points convince more people than liberal ones. <span class=read-this-if>Read this if:</span> you&rsquo;re often frustrated how others place their values, and you want to learn empathy towards them.</p>

</aside>
<div class=post-content><p>An appropriate start to my <a href=https://andrewconner.com/posts/media-diet-podcasts-audiobooks/>media diet</a>. This book isn&rsquo;t nearly as conspiratorial as you&rsquo;d think. Rather, it&rsquo;s a study of incentives: how are different forms of media incentivized? I deeply respect the work that good journalists do, but unfortunately, that&rsquo;s not what pays the bills for the news outlets. Since subscriptions are down, we&rsquo;re in a feedback cycle where poorly-researched, quickly-written hype pieces get more attention than actually impacting journalism. <span class=read-this-if>Read this if:</span> you&rsquo;re curious about reducing media consumption.</p>

These are entirely subjective, and roughly try to capture the personal enjoyment and usefulness to me, and how
likely I'd recommend it to others. Don't read too much into this unless you love my judgement. Rough guidelines:
<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong>: Top quartile. Changed the way I think about something, or was quite enjoyable the whole way through.</li>
<li><strong>B</strong>: Above average. I was able to take away several useful things.</li>
<li><strong>C</strong>: Likely wouldn't consume again. May have value, but not a great time investment.</li>
<li><strong>F</strong>: Wouldn't consume again, didn't really get much of value.</li>
