Due to the highly likely &amp;ldquo;stop while you&amp;rsquo;re ahead&amp;rdquo; criteria, you would likely end up leaving ahead most times, and occasionally lose a lot. Of course, you didn&amp;rsquo;t change the expectancy of your play, just the distribution of outcomes.
Here&amp;rsquo;s one possible view of your bankroll:
As expected, most times you win a small amount, and occasionally—3 times in this case—you lose a lot.</description></item><item><title>Common Digital Infrastructure</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/posts/common-digital-infrastructure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/posts/common-digital-infrastructure/</guid><description>Governments, and thus us as upstanding Homo politicus beings, are accustomed to thinking about common infrastructure: organizations and structures that promote further wealth-building, but don&amp;rsquo;t always have a natural market-based mechanism to exist. We can think about them as &amp;ldquo;resource enablers&amp;rdquo;, providing economic benefit while being agnostic about value capture.
Not all of these are anti-market. For example, the electrical grid facilitates nearly the entire modern economy, and charges roughly the cost of production instead of value. We have a ton of these: communications networks, safety regulations, clean air/water infrastructure, sewage and sanitation systems, environmental productions, vaccination programs, financial regulatory frameworks, and the public postal system.</description></item><item><title>The Ladder Theory of Meaning</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/posts/ladder-theory-of-meaning/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/posts/ladder-theory-of-meaning/</guid><description>I once read a book that shattered my core. It was beautiful, effectively breaking down and building up my model of the world. Without hyperbole, how I viewed my place among others changed such that many of my life perspectives before this book seem adolescent.
Naturally, I became a That Book evangelist, telling everyone I knew about how good the book was. It was long, yes, but be patient — it&amp;rsquo;ll change the way you see the world.
I won&amp;rsquo;t tell you what it was, the reception was less enthusiastic.</description></item><item><title>Making the Internet Work for You: YouTube</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/posts/making-the-internet-work-for-you-youtube/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/posts/making-the-internet-work-for-you-youtube/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re accustomed to social network dangers: doomscrolling, the media feedback loop, polarization, etc. Their currency is attention, and thus are naturally designed to addict by providing spaced dopamine hits.
Many social networks also have incredible value, but self-control in the moment fails. Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to control them so that you pick what you get out of them. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the past several years building systems to maximize social network value, while minimizing natural feedback loops. I&amp;rsquo;ll start with YouTube, which I consider the most valuable social network to have ever existed.</description></item><item><title>“Woo” beliefs</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/posts/woo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/posts/woo/</guid><description>My default disposition is fairly rationalist—or at least, rationalist-informed—and have a gut distaste towards &amp;ldquo;the woo&amp;rdquo;. I also have plenty of curiosity and believe that wisdom is often lossily encoded in culture, so have tried and experienced quite a few things that I initially met with a wave of skepticism. Many have become significantly meaningful in my life.
Scientific reductionism is the modus operandi of thought in Western, educated circles. For it&amp;rsquo;s flaws, this approach has pushed the boundaries of our knowledge of how the world works, but consistently has blindspots between domains, with significant consequences.</description></item><item><title>Angel investing without investing</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/posts/angel-investing-without-investing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/posts/angel-investing-without-investing/</guid><description>Angel investing is—for most people—a bad investment. As such, accreditation is rarely the limiting factor to being able to realize outsized investment returns, because variance is incredibly high while median performance is tepid. However, it can have very net positive externalities that include networking opportunities, learning about venture, getting involved in exciting companies, and honing your startup skillset.
If you’re interested in angel investing, but don’t yet have a portfolio large enough to support diversified meaningful bets, there’s a few options to start down this path and capture a lot of the value you’re after.</description></item><item><title>Append List System: How to stay on top of everything</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/posts/append-list-system/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/posts/append-list-system/</guid><description>For several years, I&amp;rsquo;ve developed a strategy that I use to stay on top of all my personal and work projects, while not getting overwhelmed by infinitely-growing lists. Using this strategy, I&amp;rsquo;m able to regularly surprise people about how I remembered to do some passing request they had, and am able to bring back concepts after weeks of dormancy. It&amp;rsquo;s quite simple, and adaptable to many different tools.

In it, he surveys how accreditation laws are keeping everyone but the already-rich from investing in startups. The argument is simple: the wealthy are capturing returns that most of America doesn&amp;rsquo;t have access to and average investors are missing out. Instead, big tech companies are getting dumped on public markets after most of their appreciation has happened.</description></item><item><title>Break social media habits by removing the default feeds</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/posts/productivity-break-habits-removing-feeds/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/posts/productivity-break-habits-removing-feeds/</guid><description>Social networks work because they form habit loops. You visit, and get a boost of dopamine, fueled by novelty. It&amp;rsquo;s always new, and randomly rewards. Even if you&amp;rsquo;re disappointed with what you see, it&amp;rsquo;s too late. But, what if you do get value from them, and just want to be in control?

Partly from exhaustion. Partly because I realized how I wasn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>informed&lt;/em>, I was &lt;em>entertained&lt;/em>. Mostly because a friend challenged me — to limit inputs and consume slower; to be intentional about information consumption. And I challenge you: I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how you can learn more and avoid the outrage rollercoaster by going slower.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Request for Product: a new Calendar experience</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/posts/a-new-calendar-experience/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/posts/a-new-calendar-experience/</guid><description>Google started a shift to real-time, online collaboration with their apps suite. Microsoft quickly chased. Both were primarily replicating a desktop environment on the web. This had many benefits: no forgetting to save, easier collaboration, a chance to drop unused features, better version control, and easier sharing. For many customers, this was an obvious improvement, and so the Shift to Cloud has continued.
Piece by piece, however, a new wave of products are entering the market that re-think the form factor of these productivity tools.</description></item><item><title>Coaching engineering managers for interviews</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/posts/coaching-engineering-managers-google-interview/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/posts/coaching-engineering-managers-google-interview/</guid><description>Google recently concluded a program where senior engineering manager candidates could get coaching before interviews, in order to help experienced people be as effective as possible during their interviews. My understanding is that they had systemic problems of engineering managers performing poorly on technical interviews, so the program was created to provide pointed feedback early in the cycle.
We&amp;rsquo;ll ignore what that may say about the interview process (where we provide &amp;ldquo;training&amp;rdquo; for candidates ahead of the interview), but the program is changing a bit now, and my role as a coach is ending.</description></item><item><title>On Generalists</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/posts/on-generalists/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/posts/on-generalists/</guid><description>Over the past couple years, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the fortune to coach engineers through their career journeys, including people currently in coding bootcamps, to startup founders, to people bored at their BigCo job. Fortune, because it&amp;rsquo;s entirely as much a benefit for me, as I synthesize patterns for the first time to improve my own career and spot opportunities.
One pattern that&amp;rsquo;s common, especially for new college grads who go straight into a FANG, is becoming specialists early. Certainly, being a proficient machine learning engineer right now is quite lucrative.</description></item><item><title>Investment Thesis for 2019</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/posts/investment-thesis-2019/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/posts/investment-thesis-2019/</guid><description>Here are my ideas that are guiding personal investments, as well as macro views. I&amp;rsquo;ve noted where I have skin in the game with current positioning, which may be useful to project my relative confidence.
You&amp;rsquo;ll notice that I have an active portfolio, while I recommend that others stick to as boring-as-possible three-fund or inexpensive target-retirement portfolios. Later, I&amp;rsquo;ll write about why I structure investments this way, but it very well may be a &amp;ldquo;do as I say, not as I do&amp;rdquo; position.</description></item><item><title>Adventures in Security and Hacking</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/posts/adventures-in-security-and-hacking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/posts/adventures-in-security-and-hacking/</guid><description>Information security has fascinated me as a hobby. Finding web vulnerabilities is a game of (ab)using a system in a permitted but unintended way. Here&amp;rsquo;s some of the more fun things I have discovered. All were all responsibly disclosed to the vendor and fixed, and outside of established bug bounty programs, I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend poking around into other people&amp;rsquo;s systems.

However, they also often do not take security seriously enough. I&amp;rsquo;ve responsibly disclosed web vulnerabilities in sites such as Pinterest, Amazon, IMDB, and many more smaller startups. Typically, the issues were very simple and avoidable by having a culture of security. Recently, I was sent a link of a site that broke many of the guidelines below. Within three minutes, I had their database credentials. The site had many flaws, but I never even had to mangle query parameters.</description></item><item><title>Gambler's Verity?</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/posts/gamblers-verity/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/posts/gamblers-verity/</guid><description>Flip a fair coin four times. Consider the cases, if any, after a heads. Since you&amp;rsquo;re flipping a fair coin—you reason—you should notice no significant patterns in the flips after a heads, because flips are independent. However, you have heard of “hot streaks” or how random events become “due”, so you record your results.
You flip H T H H, and record “tails” and “heads” (bolded the flips after a heads). You flip T T H T and record “tails” from the 4th position.</description></item><item><title>Dialogue above debate</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/posts/dialogue-above-debate/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/posts/dialogue-above-debate/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m drawn to people who engage in direct dialogue about the fundamental concepts behind complex and polarizing issues.

He explores how habits work, and how we build (and change) them.
A habit I built shortly after reading this book was reading every morning before I left for work, for at least 20 minutes. I&amp;rsquo;m a utilitarian reader — there&amp;rsquo;s many other things I&amp;rsquo;d do for pleasure — so primarily read out of a love of learning. 20 minutes is short enough that I don&amp;rsquo;t miss sleep, and long enough to make progress every day.</description></item><item><title>Launching Kifi</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/posts/launching-kifi/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/posts/launching-kifi/</guid><description>After over a year of hard work, my colleagues and friends have been working on a product that — we hope! — will revolutionize searching, bookmarks, and discovery.

We&amp;rsquo;re also bad at knowing how others think. What results is tribalism, where we over-estimate our ability to accurately model mental states and motivations of others.
Mindwise had many incredible perspectives and nuggets of information. If our greatest skill is to be able to understand the minds of others and ourself, it&amp;rsquo;s vital that we intentionally seek to improve this ability.
The book paces well, and has great insights the whole way through. I highly recommend it.</description></item><item><title>Linchpin</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/linchpin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/linchpin/</guid><description>Once I got the gist of Godlin&amp;rsquo;s point, I struggled to get through this. Though, it&amp;rsquo;s good. If, like me, you already see the value in avoiding &amp;ldquo;cog-based&amp;rdquo; work, there&amp;rsquo;s not a whole lot that is novel. If you&amp;rsquo;ve optimized your skills towards being very good, but likely replaceable, you may learn a lot. In fact, this book was recommended to me by someone who changed their work-life based on some principles here.

The story feels too wild to be true, and details the history of active US meddling in Central American governments (and the associated exploitation of labor) to support political goals. Eating bananas now feels a bit weird.</description></item><item><title>The Coddling of the American Mind</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/coddling-of-the-american-mind/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/coddling-of-the-american-mind/</guid><description>Jonathan Heidt’s The Righteous Mind has been one of my favorite reads for the past couple years, and so I was excited to read this one, specifically analyzing the shift towards several philosophies and thought patterns that produce fragile people. This shift starting in academia, but now extending to wider American culture. It’s characterized by a belief in these false ideas:
What doesn&amp;rsquo;t kill you makes you weaker Always trust your feelings Life is a battle between good people and evil people The Coddling looks closely at how we got here, and why these 3 beliefs go against how we know our psychology works.</description></item><item><title>Civilized to Death</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/civilized-to-death/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/civilized-to-death/</guid><description>For someone who believes in the transformative power of growth, technology, and culture, this book initially felt like a curmudgeon&amp;rsquo;s diss of civilization. With a bit more suspension of biases, I found myself thinking deeply about the premise.
Are we significantly better off due to technology? Christopher Ryan addresses this though historical and sociological evidence, and makes a strong case that we&amp;rsquo;re massively capable of deluding ourselves about how great things are now and how bad they were before technology.</description></item><item><title>The Wedge</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/the-wedge/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/the-wedge/</guid><description>“The wedge” are activities and practices that separate us from natural environmental responses. The book details several “wedges”, such as cold plunges, fasting, sauna use, psychedelics, sensory depravation pools, certain exercises, etc that allow practitioners to expand their normal consciousness.
Interestingly, the chapter list looks nearly like my Woo post, so I was primed to like the book. Unfortunately, my guess is that most people with exposure to biohacking or similar practices would be well-aware of most practices that he details.</description></item><item><title>Education</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/educated-a-memoir/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/educated-a-memoir/</guid><description>I read this with my wife, who liked it a bit more than I did. It&amp;rsquo;s well-written, with the pacing of a triller, focusing on a wild story of a very unusual, religious upbringing. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand the hype, though we&amp;rsquo;ve had several &amp;ldquo;Fringe Hillbilly to Successful&amp;rdquo; stories capture our imagination in recent years (such as Hillbilly Elegy).

Full disclosure: I went into this book skeptical, but tried to give it as fair of a chance as I could. Overall, his thesis is fine, and he even comes close to recognizing his own active role in the problem, but stops just shy. He’s astute at pointing out how right wing media, catering to the white, middle class in America, has polarized center-right.</description></item><item><title>Smart People Should Build Things</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/smart-people-should-build-things/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/smart-people-should-build-things/</guid><description>Before Andrew Yang was famous for losing political elections, he founded Venture for America. This book is the story and thesis of VFA, arguing against the current pipeline of sending our best and brightest to law school and management consultant companies. Instead of creating more professional service workers, he argues, we should equip and train people to build new things. In Silicon Valley, this is an obvious train of thought, but isn&amp;rsquo;t common outside. And naturally, VFA focuses primarily outside of major metropolitan areas where tech is already known to be a good career.</description></item><item><title>The Joy of Movement</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/joy-of-movement/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/joy-of-movement/</guid><description>I read this book based on an interview between Kelly McGonigal and Kevin Rose. Kelly talks about how movement is important and connected to our health, spirituality, meaning, and sense of belonging in community. I learned some new things, but overall it was mostly an enjoyable summary of how powerful movement is. The writing is pleasant to read, so if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in moving more (and more effortlessly), you&amp;rsquo;ll likely enjoy this book.</description></item><item><title>The Courage to Be Disliked</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/the-courage-to-be-disliked/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/the-courage-to-be-disliked/</guid><description>In my friend circle, this book has been both recommended as one of the most impactful reads published in the past few years, and also one of the most overrated. I think I get it.
The dialogue in the English translation—and perhaps the original?—is quite contrived and, at times, condescending. It&amp;rsquo;s a Socratic-style conversation between a young person and a sage-like philosopher, talking about Adlerian psychology.

Or, more accurately, it provides a model that celebrates the author’s brand of masculinity, and has strong critiques of how many men live currently. It embraces a deeply spiritual, mission-driven, strong idea of man-hood.
If you’re politically oriented like me, you’ll probably strongly disagree with portions of this book. I’d rather not write a specific critique of it, however, because it’d be too long, but in summary, there’s a lot that feels outdated / offensive, and a lot that provided a fresh perspective of masculinity for me.</description></item><item><title>Strong Towns</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/strong-towns/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/strong-towns/</guid><description>Friends of mine know that I love talking and complaining about American urban development philosophy. Strong Towns is a non-profit that has written about the fragility and risks of the dominate structural growth philosophy underlying many American cities and towns. Unfortunately, the blog isn&amp;rsquo;t super well structured—in my opinion—and has many ideas that are difficult to distill into a cohesive argument. The exact meanings and implications of their philosophies are fairly complex, though. Overall, they’re advocating for cities and towns to be run profitably, where growth does not obfuscate long term liabilities, and where wealth is generated and retained.</description></item><item><title>The E-Myth Revisited</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/e-myth-revisited/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/e-myth-revisited/</guid><description>In my opinion, this is one of the greatest books on business, and still applies well to tech businesses today. I&amp;rsquo;ve recommended this one for several years to founders, and read it again. If entrepreneurship is interesting to you at all, this paints a fantastic picture of how to build a business that is not dependent on you based on business design (you working on the business, rather than working on the product).</description></item><item><title>The Manual</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/the-manual-philosophers-guide-to-life/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/the-manual-philosophers-guide-to-life/</guid><description>This is the most concise book on Stoicism I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read, and is full of valuable insights. It&amp;rsquo;s surprising, in a way, how it was written so long ago, and applies so easily and directly to modern life. Sam Torode&amp;rsquo;s translations of both Mediations and The Manual are my favorite, as they re-write ideas in modern language.
I highly recommend this book if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in Stoic philosophy — everyone can get something from the wisdom in these pages.</description></item><item><title>Our Mathematical Universe</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/our-mathematical-universe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/our-mathematical-universe/</guid><description>Max Tegmark has an unusual idea: reality is just a mathematical structure. This is a bold claim about reality, so to get those of us there, he walks through a journey of what we know about our universe and how we know it. More importantly, he builds to focus on what the same mathematical underpinnings we use in our universe predict about things we can&amp;rsquo;t directly observe.
To get anywhere close to explaining his ultimate theory, he spends sufficient time explaining the cosmos, with successes and failures of previous theories, so even a non-academic can understand where multiverses came about.</description></item><item><title>Secrets of Sand Hill Road</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/secrets-of-sand-hill-road/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/secrets-of-sand-hill-road/</guid><description>Confession: I held off reading this one for several months because of the title. I assumed it was some sort of exposé on VC, or perhaps &amp;ldquo;history of A18Z&amp;rdquo;. I was entirely wrong: this book provides the background, incentives, and purpose of venture capital and starting a VC-funded company. It covers everything from governance, term sheets, equity splits, board member duties (and legal obligations), and a lot more.
The chapter on Term Sheets is worth the book alone. Despite living a short drive from Sand Hill for the past 7 years, I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen something written that&amp;rsquo;s so clear.</description></item><item><title>Dealt</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/dealt-richard-turner/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/dealt-richard-turner/</guid><description>Richard Turner is one of the most brilliant card mechanics that has ever lived. My wife and I watched this documentary covering his fascinating life and the challenges he has faced, and loved it.
As a kid, I loved card magic. I collected special decks, pamphlets from experienced magicians, and books detailing advanced techniques. Almost 15 years ago, I watched Richard Turner&amp;rsquo;s instructional DVDs Fans, Flourishes, and False Shuffles and The Cheat, and was blown away by his skills.</description></item><item><title>Why Evolution is True</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/why-evolution-is-true/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/why-evolution-is-true/</guid><description>Frankly, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to find balance on many issues that directly support or reject specific world-views. Evolution is a prime example. Nearly all scientists feel there is sufficient evidence for natural selection and evolution—including in humans—as the explanation of species breadth we see today. However, only 9% of white evangelicals agree. Even more surprising, each side is highly confident in their conclusion. They have arguments supporting their view, but it seems that neither side fully understands the other.
The result is a lot of talk past each other.</description></item><item><title>Radical Markets</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/radical-markets/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/radical-markets/</guid><description>If you believe that markets are the most efficient way to allocate resources, what if their breadth was extended to be far beyond how they&amp;rsquo;re used today? Posner and Weyl play with this concept, and deliver proposals outside the current political axis, leaving people of nearly every political persuasion both interested and aghast.
I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on the proposal they get the most attention for, regarding property ownership. They offer an economic system that would implement a wealth tax, levied on all personal property valued at whatever you publicly declare its value to be.</description></item><item><title>Stillness Is the Key</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/stillness-is-the-key/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/stillness-is-the-key/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Ryan Holiday fan, have received a ton of value from other books of his, such as Trust Me I&amp;rsquo;m Lying. So, I had this one pre-ordered since it was announced. Stoicism, virtue ethics, and meditation? I&amp;rsquo;m in.
Each of us has access to more information than we could reasonably use. We tell ourselves that it&amp;rsquo;s part of our job, that we have to be &amp;ldquo;on top of things,&amp;rdquo; and so we give up precious time to news reports, meetings, and other forms of feedback&amp;hellip; We must stop this.</description></item><item><title>Sapiens</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/sapiens/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/sapiens/</guid><description>Yuval Noah Harari narrates the history of human kind, starting from pre-history with many types of sapiens roaming the world, to modern days. Large popular works often make for wide targets of criticism—which you&amp;rsquo;d see about Sapiens if you looked around. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to be critical of, but for me—uneducated in much of the anthropology and sociology underpinnings—there&amp;rsquo;s also a lot to take away. Frankly, many of the vocal criticisms miss the point. Harari&amp;rsquo;s greatest flaw is how he narrates as if detached from what he speaks about, as an unaffiliated observer reporting facts and observations; however, he frequently mixes well-agreed history with his opinions.</description></item><item><title>Nonviolent Communication</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/nonviolent-communication/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/nonviolent-communication/</guid><description>Nonviolent Communication best thought of as a philosophy of language, and presents a communication technique that encourages compassion and giving from the heart. It centers around how language builds implicit power structures. It&amp;rsquo;s an all-inclusive framework, but can be borrowed from as useful. The key parts are identifying observations, feelings, needs, and requests.
I got a lot from this book, and it has improved my communication with others significantly. Some ideas feel a bit out there (such as not saying &amp;ldquo;I love you&amp;rdquo;, because, according to Rosenberg, it&amp;rsquo;s largely meaningless), but I&amp;rsquo;ve incorporated the observations → feelings → needs → requests flow.</description></item><item><title>How Not to Die</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/how-not-to-die/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/how-not-to-die/</guid><description>Spoiler: eat plants. I love this book, and am frustrated by it. Lots to love: Dr. Greger is motivated to help people be healthy and live longer; there&amp;rsquo;s nothing else. The first part of the book looks at all the top modern killers (heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer, &amp;hellip;), and gives evidence supporting plant-based diets. It&amp;rsquo;s very well cited, and he&amp;rsquo;s quite intelligent. Just like when reading Keto books, there&amp;rsquo;s almost this underlying conspiratorial overlay on much of the evidence.</description></item><item><title>High Growth Handbook</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/high-growth-handbook/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/high-growth-handbook/</guid><description>There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of writing about how to start a company, but how do you take a company from early product-market fit to hypergrowth? It turns out, not many people have done this. Leading fast growing companies is a still earned through experience, with few people having the opportunity to have done this. A lot of this knowledge has been passed on through coaching and mentorship.
This book is a reference, mostly useful when growth situations come up and you need help.</description></item><item><title>Undone</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/undone/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/undone/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s a sci-fi, fantasy, and murder mystery animated show, rolled into one. It tackles time travel, mental illness, and reality. Go in fresh — don&amp;rsquo;t read any reviews or commentary, and commit to the whole season. The whole series is less than 3 hours, and comes into its own towards the end.</description></item><item><title>The End of Average</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/the-end-of-average/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/the-end-of-average/</guid><description>Our culture optimizes for &amp;ldquo;the average&amp;rdquo;. This isn&amp;rsquo;t saying we encourage everyone to be average, but we measure from the average. This breaks down when a measure is &amp;ldquo;jagged&amp;rdquo;. Consider people of different sizes, and you&amp;rsquo;re tasked to sort them from smallest to biggest. Do you do it by height? Well, this would rank a 1.5m tall obese person as &amp;ldquo;smaller&amp;rdquo; than a 1.6m very thin person. By weight? This has the same problem. As it turns out, &amp;ldquo;size&amp;rdquo; is jagged.</description></item><item><title>The Personalized Diet</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/the-personalized-diet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/the-personalized-diet/</guid><description>An inspiration for Levels, but could be a lot shorter. The universal best diet doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist because people respond differently to foods. The best way to find out how you respond is to measure it. Unfortunately, the end of the book, with the actual protocol, is disappointing. They recommend using a finger prick, and taking a few point measurements after meals. From my own experience wearing a continuous glucose monitor, this is far too noisy.</description></item><item><title>Deep Medicine</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/deep-medicine-how-artificial-intelligence-can-make-healthcare-human-again/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/deep-medicine-how-artificial-intelligence-can-make-healthcare-human-again/</guid><description>Another health book during my research for my new startup. It won&amp;rsquo;t surprise many technologists that ML is changing healthcare. Topol introduces us to the future of medicine: how humans will work with machines to provide better healthcare. He talks about what assumptions we should be careful of when designing AI health systems, and what the future may look like. He&amp;rsquo;s critical of shallow medicine, which he claims most healthcare practitioners currently offer. Instead, he sees a future where full patient context can be used to provide personalized, targeted care.</description></item><item><title>Free Will</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/free-will/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/free-will/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve appreciated a lot of what Sam Harris has created (such as Waking Up, and especially his meditation app of the same name), so wasn&amp;rsquo;t unfamiliar with his arguments. This one&amp;rsquo;s short, and is okay. His arguments are not the most intellectually rigorous, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that was his intention. Rather than an exploration of determinism, his goal is to show that if you look closely for &amp;ldquo;the one who thinks,&amp;rdquo; it disappears. Thoughts appear in consciousness, and the autonomy we believe we have is an illusion — in fact, the illusion isn&amp;rsquo;t even there.</description></item><item><title>The Art of Gathering</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/the-art-of-gathering/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/the-art-of-gathering/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re social beings, and wonderful things happen when we gather. Great gatherings, though, don&amp;rsquo;t happen by accident. They have intentionality behind who is and isn&amp;rsquo;t invited, what we gather for, how long we are together, how we conclude, and how we&amp;rsquo;ll remember the time together. Parker is a virtuoso at human gatherings, and shares her wisdom on how to gather well.

It&amp;rsquo;s both the story of his career as the federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, but also about the world we live in. How do we effectively deliver and fight for justice? How do our leaders affect its grasp?
&amp;ldquo;[T]he rule of law&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;due process&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;presumed innocent&amp;rdquo; seem to do service these days more as political slogans than as bedrock principles… It seems preferred these days to demonize one&amp;rsquo;s opponents rather than engage them, to bludgeon critics rather than win them over.</description></item><item><title>Waking Up</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/waking-up/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/waking-up/</guid><description>This is actually the second time I tried to read this, and the first where I succeeded. Previously, I found the philosophical diatribes encouraging my mind to wander — which is ironic, given the context. This time, I enjoyed it. From first principles, what is spirituality? How do people around the world—with different and contradictory beliefs—have spiritual experiences? Where do feelings of &amp;ldquo;oneness&amp;rdquo; come from?
Harris explores spirituality building from observations that we can analyze ourselves. It isn&amp;rsquo;t easy though: looking at the nature of consciousness is difficult, to say the least.</description></item><item><title>Big Magic</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/big-magic-creative-living-beyond-fear/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/big-magic-creative-living-beyond-fear/</guid><description>This book is delightful. I struggle with creativity: it hasn&amp;rsquo;t previously felt accessible, and never productive. Gilbert thinks that&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous.
“The universe buries strange jewels deep within us all, and then stands back to see if we can find them. The hunt to uncover those jewels — that’s creative living. The courage to go on that hunt in the first place — that’s what separates a mundane existence from a more enchanted one.”

The advice inside is likely quite useful for many people, advocating for a modern interpretation of &amp;ldquo;networking&amp;rdquo;.

It&amp;rsquo;s a book with a ton of tactics on focusing and working more effectively. However, it&amp;rsquo;s far too long, and felt like a grab-bag of all the tips and tricks the authors could come up with around productivity. Don&amp;rsquo;t go on Facebook, focus on one thing, avoid the news, exercise, don&amp;rsquo;t drink too much coffee, hang out with friends, etc.</description></item><item><title>Extreme Ownership</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/extreme-ownership/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/extreme-ownership/</guid><description>Jocko and Leif advocate for better leadership through &amp;ldquo;extreme&amp;rdquo; ownership: taking ownership of outcomes, no matter who is directly at fault. It&amp;rsquo;s a pleasant read, mixing practical &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; advice with war stories. The crux, however, could have been delivered in a blog post. You&amp;rsquo;ll be a far more effective leader when you take full ownership of everything under your purview.</description></item><item><title>Being Mortal</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/being-mortal-illness-medicine-and-what-matters-in-the-end/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/being-mortal-illness-medicine-and-what-matters-in-the-end/</guid><description>Gawande considers aging and the slow process of modern death. Told alongside the story of his own father&amp;rsquo;s death, he asks deep questions about mortality, end of life care, and autonomy. In an age of copious medical options, he advocates for a more holistic perspective on aging. He advocates for simple things, such as focusing on quality of life—which paradoxically often extends life, more than aggressive disease management. The book takes courage, especially if you have loved ones going through end of life care.</description></item><item><title>Thinking in Bets</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/thinking-in-bets/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/thinking-in-bets/</guid><description>Annie Duke, renowned poker player, writes about applying poker thinking to life. Specifically, separating outcomes from expected value, and making choices with incomplete information. If you&amp;rsquo;ve played a lot of poker—or, traded in financial markets—there&amp;rsquo;s not too much surprising here.
In terms of applicable value, the lesson is fairly short, and could have been a blog post. Seek contrarian opinions and evidence against your biases. Don&amp;rsquo;t blame negative outcomes on bad luck or necessarily bad decision making: the outcome only has a loose connection to the quality of the decision.</description></item><item><title>The Righteous Mind</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/the-righteous-mind/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/the-righteous-mind/</guid><description>This book changed the way I thought about morals, beliefs, and communication. Presented as a philosophy of morals—such as surveying the different types of morals we see in cultures—this book craft-fully made me think about my own moral compass. What do I value? Where do I place my values?
We make decisions without critical thinking, and are masters at explaining our decisions with rationality. We have this (shared) illusion that our beliefs are based in rationality, and thus when we disagree, we hit roadblocks.</description></item><item><title>Trust Me, I'm Lying</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/trust-me-im-lying/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/media-diet/trust-me-im-lying/</guid><description>An appropriate start to my media diet. This book isn&amp;rsquo;t nearly as conspiratorial as you&amp;rsquo;d think. Rather, it&amp;rsquo;s a study of incentives: how are different forms of media incentivized? I deeply respect the work that good journalists do, but unfortunately, that&amp;rsquo;s not what pays the bills for the news outlets. Since subscriptions are down, we&amp;rsquo;re in a feedback cycle where poorly-researched, quickly-written hype pieces get more attention than actually impacting journalism.

I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to break previous URLs, but my new posts have entirely new paths, so a simple path-for-path 301 redirect won&amp;rsquo;t work. Most importantly, I wanted the redirection to require nearly no maintenance and be near free.
To avoid running a small server, I considered serverless approaches that would handle the URL rewriting for me.</description></item><item><title>Essential Slick review</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/posts/essential-slick-review/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/posts/essential-slick-review/</guid><description>Essential Slick by Jonathan Ferguson and Richard Dallaway was recently updated to include Slick 3, which was a big update from Slick 2. Slick is a “functional relational mapping” library for Scala. Instead of focusing on Table ↔ Object relations, Slick uses functional programming concepts to build queries, bind data, and stream results. In Slick 3, the preferred API treats queries and IO operations (called DBIO) as values, which can be modified and stored without the presence of a database. This is familiar to anyone who has used scalaz&amp;rsquo;s Task or Haskell&amp;rsquo;s IO.</description></item><item><title>Using Java Futures in Scala</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/posts/using-java-future-in-scala/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/posts/using-java-future-in-scala/</guid><description>&lt;p>Occasionally, you may need to interface with Java &lt;code>Future&lt;/code>s in Scala.

Since Play can&amp;rsquo;t reasonably know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing with the body, they can&amp;rsquo;t aggressively delete the file after the result is returned. Their solution is to clean up the file when the variable is garbage collected, using Java&amp;rsquo;s finalize—rarely seen in the Scala world. Since the TemporaryFile is held inside request (request.body: TemporaryFile), this is usually reasonable since request won&amp;rsquo;t be GCed during the lifecycle of the request.</description></item><item><title>Scala Days 2015 Talks</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/posts/scala-days-2015-talks/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/posts/scala-days-2015-talks/</guid><description>Scala Days 2015 talks have posted.

Code from the Java 8 project Play! Framework Meetup Group
Java 8 heralds a new era of reactive programming, with lambdas and promises taking the limelight as the bright new features of the language. To best take advantage of these features, Play Framework offers a ground up asynchronous full stack web framework, with a high velocity development environment, making it the most natural web framework to use with Java 8.</description></item><item><title>Durango, Colorado</title><link>https://andrewconner.com/posts/durango/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrewconner.com/posts/durango/</guid><description>After living in the Bay Area for 8 years, in January 2021 my wife and I (and dog!) moved to Durango, Colorado. We had road tripped through previously, and loved the pace of life, access to outdoors, fitness culture, and walkability. It&amp;rsquo;s a small mountain town that has avoided stains of suburbia. We walk to the grocery store, and have easy access to mountain biking, river sports, rock climbing, hiking, skiing, and more. We&amp;rsquo;re thrilled with our decision.

However, in general, msot people aren&amp;rsquo;t intentional about finding things that make day to day life better, don&amp;rsquo;t take inventory of the things that they benefit from the most, and recommend specific products that work well to others.
I encourage you to do this exercise for yourself. You may grow a deeper appreciation for things in your life that truly make your days better, and can easily share them with others.</description></item></channel></rss>
