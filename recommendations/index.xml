Here&amp;rsquo;s where I keep a list of some of my favorite products.
Home products Home gear Megapro Multi Bit Screwdriver, $25, Amazon This screwdriver is wonderful: it is easy to use (with a rotating end), has 15 bits that store inside the handle, and has lasted me many years.
Squatty Potty, $20, Amazon Seems like a gimmick, but significantly improves bathroom time. I put one in every bathroom. Guests love it.</description></item></channel></rss>
